# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```sh
# create a new project
bunx sv create my-app
```

To recreate this project with the same configuration:

```sh
# recreate this project
bunx sv create --template minimal --types ts --add prettier eslint paraglide="languageTags:en, zh+demo:yes" --install bun weatherv3

# add UnoCSS
bun add -d unocss @unocss/reset @unocss/extractor-svelte
```

## Developing

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```sh
bun install
bun run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
bun run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```sh
bun run build
```

You can preview the production build with `bun run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
